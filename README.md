Learn rails implementation (SELF-TAUGHT)

For the past six year I have been in the pharmaceutical industry working on computer systems, administering a business intelligence solution, and teaching users how to use the system.  I take an analytical view of what  is happening and work through the process by trying various solutions.  I work well independently or as a member of a team.  I have worked in fast-paced environments most of my life and am very goal-oriented and deadline driven.
